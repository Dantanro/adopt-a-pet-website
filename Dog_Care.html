                <ul class="Carelist">
                    <li>Puppies eight to 12 weeks old need four meals a day.</li>
                    <li>Feed puppies three to six months old three meals a day.</li>
                    <li>Feed puppies six months to one year two meals a day.</li>
                    <li>When your dog reaches his first birthday, one meal a day is usually enough.</li>
                    <li>For some dogs, including larger canines or those prone to bloat, it's better to feed two smaller meals.</li>

                <h2>Exercise</h2>
                <p class="Carelist">Every dog needs to exercise not just to burn calories, but it stimulates their minds, and it allows them to stay healthy. 
                    Depending on the dog breed there's a different amount of need for exercise. 
                    So, make sure to have supervised fun and games with your pets and make sure it satisfies his instinctual urges.</p>


                <h2>Housing</h2>
                <p class="Carelist">Your pet needs a warm quiet place to rest.
                    Usually, dogs like a training crate or a dog bed with a clean blanket or pillow for questioning.
                    Make sure to clean the bed off then because dogs spend a lot of time outdoors where they get dirty.
                    And in your house make sure the dog has access to shade and cool water.
