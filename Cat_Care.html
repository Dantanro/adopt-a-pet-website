                    <li>By the time kittens are five to six weeks old, they should be nibbling on a high-quality dry food consistently</li>
                    <li>Kittens can be fed free-choice—which means food is available at all times</li>
                    <li>As a general rule of thumb, we recommend that all cats be fed twice daily using the portion control feeding method</li>
                    <li>Milk should not be fed to cats as a treat or a substitute for water.</li>
                    <li>Treats should be no more than 5-10% of the diet.</li>

                <h2>Housing</h2>
                <p class="Carelist">For your cats housing, it should have its own clean and dry place in your room to sleep and rest.
                    Maybe a cat bed, a bunch of warm blankets or towels.
                    Most of the time cats pick their own place to sleep around your room so just make sure that it has a space.

                <h2>Scratching</h2>
                <p class="Carelist">
                    Cats need to scratch, because “when a cat scratches, the old outer nail sheath is pulled off and the
                    sharp, smooth claws underneath are exposed”<a href="https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/cat-care/cat-nutrition-tips">ASPCA</a>.
                    For your cat not to use your couch as a scratcher. Make sure to provide a scratching post or a scratching pad.
                    <br><br>
                    Cutting their nails should be done every two to three weeks to make sure they're not too sharp.
                    We don't want anyone getting injured.
